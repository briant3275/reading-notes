## React Docs - Thinking in React

    1. The single responsibility principle is that each component should only have one responsibilty, if it grows and ends up having more it should be further split up
    2. Building a static version of an application means to build a data model that renders but has no interactivity
    3. Once you have your static version built you need the interactivity (make it dynamic)
    4. 3 question to determine if something is state:
        - Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it probably isn’t state
        - Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it probably isn’t state
        - Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component? If so, it isn’t state
    5. You can determine where state needs to live by
        - Identify every component that renders something based on that state.
        - Find a common owner component (a single component above all the components that need the state in the hierarchy).
        - Either the common owner or another component higher up in the hierarchy should own the state.
        - If you can’t find a component where it makes sense to own the state, create a new component solely for holding the state and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common owner component

## Higher-Order Functions

    1. Higher order functions are functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them
    2. line 2 of the greaterThan function is returning all m's that are greater than the given value n
    3. The map method transforms an array by applying a function to all of its elements and building a new array from the returned values

## Things I want to know more about

    - functions that create new functions and more examples of why one would want to implement this
    - controlling data flow with higher-level functions
