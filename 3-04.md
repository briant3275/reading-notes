## What is OAuth

  1. OAuth is an authorization protocol that describes how unrelated servers and services can safely allow authenticated access without sharing the initial, related, single logon credential.

  2. An example would be signing on to a site using your google sign in

  3. Steps on how it works
    - first two sites connect via using OAuth provided users identity
    - second site generates a one-time token and secret unique to the transaction
    - first site gives this token and secret to user's software
    - user's software presents this token and secret to the authorization provider
    - If not already authenticated to authorization provider, user may be asked to authenticate
    - The user or software approves a particular transaction type at the first site
    - user is given approved access token
    - user gives token to first site
    - first site gives to second
    - second site lets first site access their site on behalf of user
    - user sees a successfully completed transaction
  
  4. OpenID is like OAuth but for user authentication as opposed to authorization

## Authorization and Authentication flows

  1. authorization is allowing access, authentication is identifying user as authentic

  2. Authorization Code Flow exchanges an Authorization Code for a token

  3. Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) uses additional security

  4. Implicit Flow with Form Post is intended for applications which are unable to securely store Client Secrets

  5. Client Credentials Flow is when the system authenticates and authorizes the app rather than a user

  6. Device Authorization Flow is when the device asks the user to go to a link on their computer or smartphone and authorize the device

  7. Resource Owner Password Flow requests that users provide credentials (username and password)
