# React Forms
    1. A controlled component is an input element that is controlled by react
    2. We update state as the user enters them so we can pass the value around
    3. We have the input field set the value, so we can target it with this.state.value ?

# Conditional operator explained
    1. allows us to do something(run a block of code, set a value to true or false) if a condition is met
    2 x === y ? 'true' : 'false';

    condition ? value if true : value if false

    -The condition is what youâ€™re actually testing. The result of your condition should be true or false or at least coerce to either boolean value.

    -A ? separates our conditional from our true value. Anything between the ? and the : is what is executed if the condition evaluates to true.

    -Finally a : colon. If your condition evaluates to false, any code after the colon is executed.

    you can nest ternaries
    example:  let price = isStudent ? 8 : isSenior ? 6 : 10

## Things I want to know more about
    - how to target user input if we have event handler on user field
    - what would be an example of coercing to either boolean value?
