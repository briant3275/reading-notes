# Welcome fellow mammals

My name is Brian Thornburg, my pronouns are he/him. I'm from Cedar Rapids Iowa and currently work as a cook at Big Grove Brewpub. I attended University of Northern Iowa studying studio art and still enjoy working on illustration, painting, digital work, print and performance. I am married to my majesctic wife Abby with which I have sired a child, Milo, who is 18 months old. Most of my time is dedicated towards spending time with them followed by cooking, gardening, doing art, coding, gaming and petting our three cats.


## Growth Mindset


Believing in your ability to learn new things and to not become discouraged when faced with difficulties but rather use them as opportunities to expand your knowledge 

**Reminders on how to stay in a growth mindset**
1. "Dude, suckin' at something is the first step to being sorta good at something." - Jake the Dog from Adventure Time
2. When frustrated with a problem, take a break and revisit the problem with fresh eyes
3. Do not think less of yourself when comparing yourself to others with more skills, use them as an example of what skills you can learn

*For my final trick I present you with a awe-inspiring line of italicized text*

#### Text Editors

All computers will come with a generic form of text editor such as "Text Edit" or "Notepad" however not all text editors have the same features/plugins. Some features that may come in handy are syntax highlighting and code completion, as well as word completion and function completion. Some of these editors and their functions may align better with the coding language you plan to use.
