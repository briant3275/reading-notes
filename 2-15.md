# 2-15 Notes

## React Lifecycle

    1. render happens before componentDidMount
    - the 3 phases of the lifecycle are Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting
    2. a constructor() is the first thing to happen
    3. in order in which they happen: constructor, render, componentDidMount, React Updates, componentWillUnmount
    4. the componentDidMount is used to load anything using a network request, initialize the DOM or set up subscriptions

## Bootstrap

## Netlify

## React State vs Props

    1. any data type you'd like
    2. Props are outside of a component and are handled outside, state is inside a component and can only be handled by that component
    3. we re render when state updates
    4. any data type you'd like
