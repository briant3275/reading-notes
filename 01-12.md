# Lists and Keys
    1. .map() returns an array of the same length
    2. we can use .map() to loop through an array and return values which can then be assigned to elements that will be rendered in the dom
    3. each list item needs a key
    4. keys are useful for making sure the correct component has the correct state

# Spread operator
    1. & 2. the spread operator ... is a syntax for adding items to arrays, combining arrays, combining objects, and spreading an array out into a functions arguments
    3. const myArray = [`🤪`,`🐻`,`🎌`]
        const yourArray = [`🙂`,`🤗`,`🤩`]
        const ourArray = [...myArray,...yourArray]
    4. const fewFruit = ['🍏','🍊','🍌']
        const fewMoreFruit = ['🍉', '🍍', ...fewFruit]
    5. const objectOne = {hello: "🤪"}
        const objectTwo = {world: "🐻"}
        const objectThree = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo, laugh: "😂"}
        console.log(objectThree) // Object { hello: "🤪", world: "🐻", laugh: "😂" }
        const objectFour = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo, laugh: () => {console.log("😂".repeat(5))}}
        objectFour.laugh() // 😂😂😂😂😂

# Passing functions between components
    1. the first step is to create a function next to the state we want to change
    2. incrementing is going to add a certain value to something
    3.
