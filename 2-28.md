## SQL vs NoSQL

| SQL | NoSQL |
|---|---|
| relational DB | non-relational DB |
| table based databases | document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores |
| predefined schema | dynamic schema |
| scaled by increasing the horse-power of the hardware | increasing the databases servers in the pool of resources |
| ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data, which is very powerful | syntax of using UnQL varies from database to database |

1. SQL is good for large data of key=value pairs
2. SQL database examples: MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL. NoSQL database examples: MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb
3. document based:collection of key-value pair, documents, graph databases or wide-column stores
4. NoSQL database examples: MongoDB, CouchDB, Redis
5. NoSQL is best for hierarchical data storage
6. Best Scalability: It depends, for SQL you can manage increasing load by increasing the CPU, RAM, SSD, etc, on a single server. For NoSQL ou can add few more servers easily in your NoSQL database infrastructure to handle the large traffic

1. SQL stands for Structured Query Language
2. A relational database works in an assumed structured way, supports SQL language
3. Relational DB deals with tables
4. schema is defined by fields, gives structure to DB
5. A NoSQL DB is Non-structured, document based
6. NoSQL works with documents, no schema
7. documents
8. NoSQL is more flexible because there is no implied schema
9. The disadvantage of NoSQL is you might have duplicate data, no schema to rely on,
