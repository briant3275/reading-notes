# React Forms
    1. A controlled component is an input element that is controlled by react
    2. We update state as the user enters them so we can pass the value around
    3.

# Conditional operator explained
    1. allows us to run a block of code if a condition is met
    2 x === y ? 'true' : 'false';

## Things I want to know more about
    - how to target user input if we have event handler on user field
    - coercing to either boolean value?
