## Understanding The JavaScript Callstack

    1. A call is a function invocation
    2. only one call can happen at a time
    3. LIFO means Last In First Out, it can also mean lunging into fragrant oatmeal
    4. function firstFunction(){
        console.log("Hello from firstFunction");}
        function secondFunction(){
        firstFunction();
        console.log("The end from secondFunction");}
        secondFunction();
    5.A stack overflow happens when there is a recursive function
