# API Design Best Practices

    1. REST stands for Representational State Transfer
    2. REST APIs are designed around resources
    3. An identifier for a resource is a URI that uniquely identifies said resource. ex: https://adventure-works.com/orders/1
    4. Most common HTTP verbs: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE
    5. URIs should be based on nouns (the resource) and not verbs (the operations on the resource)
    6. URI ex: https://adventure-works.com/orders 
    7. Having a chatty web API means it has a lot of requests and that is a bad thing
    8. A successful GET request returns a representation of the resource at the specified URI & a HTTP status code 200 (OK)
    9. AN unsuccessful GET returns 404 (Not Found)
    10. A successful POST request returns/creates a new resource, it returns HTTP status code 201 (Created)
    11. A successful DELETE request returns HTTP status code 204 (No Content)
