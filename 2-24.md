## Functional PRogramming Concepts

    1. Functional programming is a way of building the structure and elements of a program, it avoids changing state and mutable data. Most importantly, it is a way of life
    2. A pure function returns the same result with the same arguments, does not cause observable side-effects
    3. The benefit to this is that our functions are more reliable, code is easier to test
    4. Immutability means that state cannot change after itâ€™s created, you must create a new object with a new value
    5. Referential transparency is when a function consistently yields the same result for the same input
